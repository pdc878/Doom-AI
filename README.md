# Doom-AI


## Overview

Welcome to Doom AI, where an environment to test renforcement learning models in a classic first-person shooter, Doom. This project is dedicated to developing and testing models capable of navigating, understanding, and mastering the intricate world of Doom. This code is open-sourced to test different reward, score and models.

## Features

- Flexible Q-Learning Model Customization: Inside the model.py file, users have the flexibility to adjust the Q-learning model parameters, including learning rates, discount factors, and exploration rates, to optimize performance and learning efficiency in various game scenarios.
- Dynamic Reward and Scoring System: The project offers a customizable reward and scoring system, allowing users to experiment with different strategies for incentivizing AI behavior. This flexibility is key to discovering effective approaches for training models in the Doom environment.
- Extensible Environment Setup: Our setup supports modifications to the Doom game environment, enabling the testing of AI models under a wide range of conditions, from simple mazes to complex battle scenarios.
- Real-time Training Metrics: Track your AI's performance with real-time metrics, reward and scoring metrics.
